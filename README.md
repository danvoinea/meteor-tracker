TODO:
1. design & css fixes
2. there's a bug at the comments form when submitting - it resets the form and loses the complaint id id
3. For some weird reason, I can't seem to be able to get the comments made by my user in the dashboard.
4. Differentiating between Submit & Resolve buttons, and requiring the amount when you click on Resolve.
5. marking an item resolved in thecomments section (partially done).
6. code cleanup
